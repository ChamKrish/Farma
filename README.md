## Overview
  One of the main occupation in our India is Farming and that is now on a very miserable condition because of improper knowledge for farmers.They lack the main thing to take care of, that is education.  
  They are not aware of much things around them so they can’t figure out the solutions for their problems.They don’t even know how to solve them.
## Project
  This project mainly focuses on bringing the information to one place that too accessible by farmers.In these days, most people are having access to smart phones and so easy way to learn something is through mobiles.  
  Through this app farmers can know present weather condition and water facility and any climate disturbances that may gonna occur and they can send their problems to their panchayat or to any agriculture based colleges so that they can solve them.This can also provide some news regarding the agriculture and any steps been taking by government for farmers.
